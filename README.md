#Vidya Tutorial: Starting with Data

##Description

These are the files that accompany the [Vidya](http://www.vidyasource.com) video tutorial 
[Starting with Data](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A) on accessing and visualizing
data on the web.


##Intended Audience

Beginners in software development who want to learn just enough to access data on the web and visualize it on their own
websites or mobile device applications.

##Instructions

First, see if you have Python installed on your machine by opening up a terminal and typing *python*. If you see a prompt
that looks like >>> then you are set. Otherwise, [download and install Python](http://www.python.org/getit/).

Once you have Python running, download the files and navigate to the top level in your terminal. Just type

*python services.py*

and navigate to *http://127.0.0.1:5000/* in your browser. If you see "Everything is running!," then you're running the
simple REST application described in the tutorial.

Follow along with the tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24LVc8Bb65SF6LW-SLog9A)
or play with the HTML, SVG, Python, or D3 code yourself in your favorite editor to see what happens.
